20140219 / 0.3.0
  * Support nn_poll function for checking socket reading/writing availability

  * Support nn_symbol_info function

  * Support reallocmsg function for reallocating messages previously allocated by nn_allocmsg

  * Support nn_device for messages forwarding between two sockets

20130327 / 0.2.0
	* Support nn_symbol function for setting up all constants in the binding.
	
	* Remove support for nn_version function.
	
	* Change #attach_function calls to use options hash for :blocking => true.
	  This is cleaner and less noisy than all of the "@blocking = true" lines
		before the #attach_function call.

20130220 / 0.1.6
	* Several fixes for tcp string handling have made it to nanomsg trunk,
		so I can now re-enable those specs.
		
	*	For MRI Ruby, add @blocking=true before all function attachments to instruct
		the FFI gem to release the GIL.
		
	*	Fixed a nn_recv spec to only read a specific number of bytes from a received
		string. Must note that the library does not null terminate strings on its
		own so we need to be very careful how many bytes are read from received
		strings.
		

20130215 / 0.1.5
	*	libnanomsg has removed the nn_init and nn_term functions. Updated
		specs to remove those features.
		
	*	Added NN_BUS protocol.


20130204 / 0.1.0
	* Initial release. Wrapped the nanomsg library as of commit 
		5ded934af0.
